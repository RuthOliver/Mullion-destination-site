A basic responsive design project using only HTML5 and CSS3.

My goal was to create a fully responsive card design landing page using CSS grid. 
I was hugely inspired by a YouTube tutorial by Layout Land : "Responsive Mondrian â€“ a demo of CSS Grid".

My thought was that local businesses could "sponser" a tile for a varied price range depending on the size.

To improve this project in the future I would like to review compatibility with older browsers.
