This project was an attempt to simulate a real-life use case of a small tourist village attempting to appeal to a wider audience.
The village of Mullion is a real place and I was born and raised there for the first 22 years of my life. The place is dear to my heart.
This project is intend as nothing more than a learning exercise and will never be made commercially availiable or be accessed by the general public.
